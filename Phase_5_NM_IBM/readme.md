<h5>Phase_5 :</h5>
<p>This folder contains the files related to the fifth phase of the IBM Traffic Management project. The main goal of this phase is to predict the traffic congestion level using machine learning models and historical data. The following files are included in this folder:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Jupyter Notebook:</b> This file contains the code used for the congestion prediction. The notebook shows how the data was preprocessed, how the machine learning models were trained, and how the results were evaluated.</li>
  <li><b>PDF report:</b> This file summarizes the findings of the congestion prediction. The report includes the accuracy of the models, the most important features, and the recommendations for future improvements.</li>
  <li><b>Android app:</b> This app, named <b>MapMyRoute</b>, allows users to find the optimal route based on the congestion level. The app uses the machine learning models developed in the Jupyter Notebook to predict the congestion level. The app also provides real-time traffic updates and alternative routes.</li>
  <li><b>Screenshot:</b> This file shows the interface of the <b>MapMyRoute</b> app.</li>
  <li><b>Simulation video:</b> This video shows the traffic flow and the congestion level in a graphical way on Traffic congestion sites. And demonstration of Traffic light modification based on the vehicle deduction data.</li>
